# About CNCF TAG Contributor Strategy

Contributor Strategy is a [Technical Advisory Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md) (TAG) responsible for contributor experience, sustainability, governance, and openness guidance to help CNCF community groups and projects with their own contributor strategies for a healthy project. 

If you are looking for how-to resources produced by the TAG, please visit
